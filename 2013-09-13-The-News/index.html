      <div>

        <img class="leadImage" src="images/leadArticlePhoto.jpg"/  style="float:right";>        <p>CUPERTINO, Calif. -- Apple pulled back the curtain on its buzzy iPhone 5 successor at a Tuesday launch event held here at the company's headquarters.

Because Twitter filed for an initial public offering confidentially, the world won't know for some time. Research firm eMarketer estimates that Twitter's ad revenue will more than double this year to nearly $583 million...</p>
