          <p class="story"> CUPERTINO, Calif. -- Apple pulled back the curtain on its buzzy iPhone 5 successor at a Tuesday launch event held here at the company's headquarters. Physically, the gold, "space gray," or white aluminum iPhone 5S closely resembles the iPhone before it (bye-bye, basic black), but Apple has bulked up its flagship smartphone with a fingerprint scanner, a faster 64-bit A7 processor, and high-end camera features. What the 5S doesn't have, though, is a larger screen: it's exactly the same as last year's iPhone 5, and Apple's other new iPhone, the 5C and if I claim to be a wise man, it surely means that I don't know...
        Touch ID scans subepidermal skin layers, Apple says, and has "360-degree readability," meaning it should be able to recognize your fingerprint regardless of orientation.

In addition to the Touch ID sensor doubling as your security key instead of a four-key password, you can also purchase apps and other iTunes content with a tap of your finger. Fingerprint information is never available to other apps, Apple says, nor will it be stored in the cloud.

As for guest profiles, yes, you can store details for multiple fingers -- yours and someone else's.

In classic Apple style, Touch ID is easy to set up as you tap and circle your finger to capture multiple fingerprint angles. In fact, setup is a bit like a video game that collects more prints the more you tap. After that, you scan your fingerprint and voila, you're in. The entire setup process takes a minute or less. Log-in is as quick as clicking.

How did it feel during a brief hands-on session after Apple's event? Surprisingly easy and fast. We were able to have Touch ID scan our fingerprint after about a dozen or so tap-clicks. After the process is done, the scan happens instantaneously: it feels just like clicking a home button. The scan becomes unnoticeable. There is a little adjustment, though, to getting used to how the button now works capacitively and as a click button.

If you don't want to use the fingerprint scanner, you don't have to. There's still the option to use the four-digit PIN password or no password at all. The benefit? No longer having to enter your iTunes ID in order to make purchases.
