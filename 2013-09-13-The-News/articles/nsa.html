      <h1 class="article_h1">NSA Backdoors Could Cost US Companies Billions in Business Abroad</h1>
      <h5>by Steve Gomez</h5>
        <div class="article_image"><img src="../images/nsa.jpg" /style="float:right">

          <p class="story"> The National Security Agency's efforts to include "backdoors" in U.S. companies' security products, networks and devices -- thereby making it easier for the NSA to snoop around -- could hurt business abroad.

Specifically, foreign countries could come to view U.S. firms' relationship with Washington much the same way that the U.S. views Chinese companies' relationship with Beijing, Bloomberg said -- that is, too close for comfort. Last year, Congress announced that Huawei and ZTE, two large Chinese telecoms, should not be allowed to build U.S. networks for fear that they would dish secrets to the government.

One of the more alarmist quotes from the Bloomberg article was given by San Jose-based technology analyst Rob Enderle, who said, "The National Security Agency will kill the U.S. technology industry singlehandedly."

Forrester Research hypothesized that NSA disclosures could cost U.S. tech companies US$180 billion by 2016. That amounts to 25 percent of IT services.
